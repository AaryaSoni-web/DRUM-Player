<h1>Description</h1>

<p>
This Drum Kit project is an interactive web-based drum player built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can play different drum sounds by either clicking on the on-screen buttons or pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard. The interface is styled with custom drum images and animations for a more engaging user experience. When a key or button is pressed, the JavaScript code triggers sound playback and adds a visual "pressed" animation to simulate real-time interaction. The project includes custom audio files and background images to enhance the overall look and feel of the virtual drum kit.</p>
